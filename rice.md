# RICE

To prioritize potential tasks or improvements in each category, we can apply the RICE framework. For each task, we estimate its Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, and calculate the RICE score using the formula:

$$
\text{RICE} = \frac{\text{Reach} * \text{Impact} * \text{Confidence}}{\text{Effort}}
$$

Comparing RICE scores allows us to prioritize tasks with the highest scores, which are likely to have the most significant positive effect on the TON Footsteps program with the least amount of effort. This prioritization can also influence the grant prize.

We can generally estimate these factors using the following guidelines:

1. Reach:
    - Estimate the number of people or users within the TON ecosystem affected by the task or improvement.
    - Consider the target audience or user base for the task, such as developers for a new development tool or a broader audience for a community engagement initiative.
    - Assign a numerical value to the reach (e.g., 1-10) based on the expected number of impacted people.
2. Impact:
    - Assess the potential effect of the task on the TON ecosystem, considering aspects like user satisfaction, system performance, or developer productivity.
    - Determine the impact level as high, medium, or low (assign a numerical value, e.g., 1 for low, 5 for medium, 10 for high).
3. Confidence:
    - Evaluate the certainty level in the estimated reach and impact of the task, considering factors such as available data, expertise, and resources.
    - Take into account any risks, uncertainties, or dependencies that might affect the task's outcome.
    - Assign a confidence percentage value (e.g., 50% for low confidence, 80% for medium confidence, 100% for high confidence).
4. Effort:
    - Estimate the work required to complete the task, factoring in development time, human resources, and any financial costs involved.
    - Assess the task's complexity and scope, accounting for potential challenges or obstacles.
    - Assign a numerical value to the effort (e.g., 1-10) based on the estimated work required.
